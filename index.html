        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hey, I’m Athoy — a Computer Engineering student at Budapest University of Technology and Economics (BME), driven by curiosity, creativity, and a passion for building.

My academic journey has provided me with a strong foundation in software development, cloud computing, AI, and DevOps practices. Over the years, I’ve gained hands-on experience working with languages like Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript while developing scalable backend systems, cloud-native applications, RESTful APIs, and efficient CI/CD pipelines. I’ve also worked with major cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, while exploring automation, infrastructure-as-code, and performance optimization. I enjoy combining technical knowledge with problem-solving to create practical, real-world solutions that improve efficiency, scalability, and user experience.

But outside of coding, I’m also someone who simply enjoys building things — whether it's full-stack apps, personal side projects that keep me experimenting at 2 AM, or even creative work that has little to do with lines of code. I've always scribbled ideas in a diary, and recently started sharing my thoughts and projects publicly through writing and online platforms — from technical lessons to personal experiences and late-night ramblings.

I’m equally passionate about creativity and visual storytelling. I actively explore videography, video editing, digital illustration, and design. I love using tools like Photoshop, Adobe Premiere, Illustrator, Canva, and other creative platforms to bring ideas to life visually — whether for personal projects, university work, or portfolio content. For me, technology isn’t just about code — it’s about telling stories, solving problems, and building things that people find meaningful.

Currently, I’m continuously expanding my skills across AI-powered solutions, cloud-native development, and full-stack engineering while preparing for future opportunities where I can contribute both technically and creatively. And yes — if we ever had a real conversation, I’d definitely bring up my cats. Probably more than once.

      <h3>The Impact of Universal Quantum Computing</h3>
      <p>Explores how quantum algorithms might be used in 2055 in everyday life and business. As part of a university project, we created a research-based video presentation exploring how quantum algorithms might be applied in daily life, business, and special industries by the year 2055. Together with my teammate, we selected academic literature, analyzed advantages, challenges, and potential future impacts of quantum computing. The video was fully edited using InShot, with additional stock footage sourced from Shutterstock. We added our own voice-over narration to clearly explain the key points and present the topic in an engaging format.

      <h3>Quantum AI & Machine Learning by 2100</h3>
      <p>A futuristic presentation on the evolution of Quantum AI from 2025 to 2100: breakthroughs, industry impact, ethical dilemmas, risks, and coexistence. For this project, I prepared a PowerPoint presentation exploring how quantum mechanics principles might evolve into new technologies by the year 2100. The presentation was based on literature research, where I selected and reviewed multiple sources. It covers the topic’s importance, analyzes potential advantages and challenges, and summarizes possible applications of future quantum technologies.
